### Hi there.
My name is Cole Richards. I am a current student at Santa Barbara City College, studying Computer and Data Science. I aspire to gain knowledge in many of the programming fields as I hopefully continue my studies next year at UC San Diego. I have taken classes in Python, Java, C++, and data management. I have recently been developing many projects to showcase in a portfolio website that I'll also be building.
